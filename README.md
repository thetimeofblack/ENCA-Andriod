## Description

Overwhelmed by various kinds of cleaning agents or having trouble identifying cleaning agents in a foreign country? ENCA, helps you choose the right cleaning agent.(Only China and Germany are available now, more countries are (not) coming!) ENCA provides you a platfrom with massive cleaning agent on record where you can search, add, modify, rate and comment on local cleaning agents. With our sophisticated tag system, finding the right cleaning agent is just a few clicks away. Ready to do some cleaning? Try out ENCA now!

We provide not only a fully functional version on PC or Mac with all amazing functionalities, but also an express version on Android devices which can search and look up cleaning agents. Next time you go to the supermarket, with no mood at all to make all that gestures to the clerk and describe what you want, or just too tired to look up 9 out of 10 words that you try to read, reach for your Android smart phone and run Enca express. Click few times and find the cleaning agent that you need and show the clerk, the clerk readily fetch that thing for you and here comes the happy ending.

## Install and run

- Option 1: If you are a developer and try to run the program from java command line environment, I am glad you do this! You can enter `java de.fhl.enca.application.Login` to the command line and magic will happen. (Make sure your `pwd` is correct, should be ENCA/, and your `CLASSPATH` and `PATH` are correctly configured, if you do not know how to configure those and you are using Windows, just do not run the program like this ;)) Moreover, this project is developed with Eclipse IDE, we also host the project metadata in the repository. Try to add this project into your Eclipse and run this class "de.fhl.enca.application.Login".
- Option 2: Comming up, really.

## Platform Requirement
- __PC or Mac:__ Windows 10 and OS X El Capitan with Java SE Runtime Environment 8u91 are fully tested.
- __Android:__ Android 4.1â€“4.1.2 Jelly Bean (API level 16) or later.
