ENCA, helps you choose the right cleaning agent.(Only China and Germany are available now, more countries are (not) coming!) ENCA provides you a platfrom with massive cleaning agent on record where you can search, add, modify, rate and comment on local cleaning agents.

We provide not only a fully functional version on PC or Mac with all amazing functionalities, but also an express version on Android devices which can search and look up cleaning agents.
