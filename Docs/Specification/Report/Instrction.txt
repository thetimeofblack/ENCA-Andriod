# Instruction
- Search
	* By tags
	It is easier to search for a cleaning agent using tags when you know what to clean. For example if you want to find cleaning agents that wash dishes: click on "Kitchen" in "Room" column, then click on "Dishes" in "Items" column. All cleaning agents with these two tags will be displayed in the result table. To start a new search, you need to click on "clear" button.
	* By keywords
	It is easier to search for a cleaning agent using keywords when you know its name, brand or descriptions. For example if you want to search Ecover's product, type in "Ecover" in the text field and click on "Search" or press Enter.
	* Combined
	By the way, you can use both tags and keywords at the same time to find a cleaning agent in a more accurate manner. Now I bet you know how to find Ecover's dish cleaner.
