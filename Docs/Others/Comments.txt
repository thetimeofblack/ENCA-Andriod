	not used, be careful.

# Search.java (inline comments recommended)
	- line 24:
	we only apply search on cleaning agents, so it would be type-safer to change parameter 'collection' type to CleaningAgent. (To avoid search directly on Tag for instance)
	Rename "keyword" to "query" and "subKeyword"to "keyword" to clearly show difference between a single word and words with delimiters. Because I noticed that it is "keyword" parameter for Searchable.search.
	And additionally, search activity should be a cascade behavior, that is to say, we apply search on CleaningAgent, but search query cascades down to Tag and InternationalString, then total relevance pass up.
	So, search method on each Searchable shall be reconsidered.
	Further, I also recommend put weight on different levels of relevance.
	And I recommend to separate this method into smaller private functions "split" + "search" + "order"

# Tag.java
	- line 61:
	we also need to search description for a tag, it is in class TagPreference

# TagFetcher.java
	It is a little cryptic, refactoring is recommended.

# General advice
> Inline comments is recommended for algorithm intense code block.
> We donâ€™t do prototyping in ENCA project, so make code clean and robust, as if it is for production.
